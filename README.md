# mujoco_gym

In this ongoing project, I aim to practice my understanding and implementation of RL algorithms. I chose to work on OpenAI's Gymnasium Mujoco environments, because I have been doing research on robot learning. I aim to move onto more complex simulators for locomotion and manipulation in the future, but for this project, I hope to reinforce my RL knowledge in the context of robotics.

This project works on the ant environment and the humanoid standup environment. I aim to apply VPG, PPO, and SAC to achieve strong performance in these tasks.
